# Security Policy

## Supported versions

Only the latest `main` branch is supported.

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it privately.

- Open a GitHub Security Advisory (preferred), or
- Email the maintainer(s) listed in `pyproject.toml` (if available)

Please include a clear description, impact assessment, and a reproduction path.

> Note: `fix-my-claw` can execute unattended commands (Codex-assisted remediation). Treat it as privileged operational software and run it under a restricted user with least privilege.
